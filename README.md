# gltf

This library is intended to load [.gltf files](https://www.khronos.org/gltf), a file format designed for the efficient transmission of 3D models.

### Usage

Add `gltf` to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.gltf]
git = https://github.com/Alteous/gltf.git
```

Import the crate in your library or executable:

```rust
extern crate gltf;

use gltf::Gltf;
```

Load a glTF file:

```rust
fn main() {
    let gltf = Gltf::new("Foo.gltf").unwrap();
}
```
